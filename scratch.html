        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>The goal of the game is to have the cat sprite survive as long as possible by jumping over</br>
        the basketballs. As you progress through the game the basketballs will roll down the hill faster.</br>
        The score is increased by 1 for each jump over a basketball. The game ends when the cat sprite</br>
        makes contact with a basketball.
        </p>
        <h1>Reflection Questions</h1>
        <h2>Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</h2>
        <p>I learned that there are several ways to do specific things. For example, the scoring system can count in</br>
        two ways. The first way is to make the score go up every certain amount of seconds. The second way is to make</br>
        the score go up whenever something, the ball in this case, passes a certain area.</p>
        <h2>Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve </br>
        or overcome them?</h2>
        <p>Yes, we, Chandler and I, encountered several problems. One of them was how to make the ball go faster. We </br> 
        solved this by setting a high score that u can't exceed, and we controlled every level from 1-25. Another </br> 
        problem that we encountered was time because we weren't sure what to do until we started designing the actual </br>
        game in scratch.</p>
        <h2>What aspects of your game do you like best?</h2>
        <p>I like the scoring system because I think that it's smart that the score goes up by 1 when the basketball</br>
        passes a certain point</p>
        <h2>If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</h2>
        <p>I would add a "Gameover" screen and a better winning screen.</p>
